/**
 * Review reply.
 *
 * Sends one reply to one review and records it against the review plus the reply
 * history. A reply only ever goes out because the user pressed send — nothing
 * here auto-replies, which is the guardrail from the blueprint (no unreviewed
 * AI text reaching the public).
 *
 * Replying needs a platform business API, and the only compliant one for Google
 * is not connected on this deployment yet — see `_shared/reviews.ts` for why a
 * scraped review id cannot be replied to. Until it is, this refuses with an
 * explanation instead of a generic failure; the composer keeps working so the
 * suggested reply can still be copied across by hand.
 *
 * The idempotency key is derived from the review, so a retried submit returns the
 * first result instead of posting a second reply.
 *
 * Deploy with `--no-verify-jwt` — the bearer token is a Clerk token, verified here.
