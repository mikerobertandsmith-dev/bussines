 * source, every one of them billed, so the cap is what keeps an idle drag from
 * re-running the whole sweep: inside the window the gesture reports the workspace
 * as current instead of calling any provider.
 *
 * Twenty minutes, not an hour: a catalogue crawl is a couple of minutes' work, so
 * an hour left the page showing a stale shelf for most of the time between reads,
 * and the scans are cheap enough that the spend this rations is small. The cap is
 * the only pacing there is — no cron runs these.
 *
 * It gates **starting** work, not finishing it. A catalogue crawl that outlives the
 * pull's wait is billed at the moment it starts and collected later, so a pull that
 * finds one waiting collects it even inside the window — see `pull`.

 * and one of them — `social-scan` — is itself an actor job, so the site reads have
 * to stay under the cap rather than sit beside it.
 *
 * Firing one read per watched source was the old behaviour, and on a workspace
 * with three suppliers and seven competitors that is ten jobs at once: the account
 * refuses all but the first few, and each refusal surfaces as an error on that
 * source while writing nothing.
 *
 * Two, not three, since the traffic read joined the sweep: `social-scan`
 * contributes up to two jobs of its own and `traffic-scan` one, and the plan this
 * deployment runs on allows five running together. Three site reads beside those
 * is a sixth job, and the account refuses it — which shows up as a source that
 * failed to read rather than as a busy account. Two also stays inside the memory
